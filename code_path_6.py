# # Breakout Problems Session 1
# # ðŸ’¡ Unit 6 Cheatsheet

# # To help your learning journey with linked lists, we've put together a guide to common concepts and syntax you will use throughout Unit 6 breakout problems. 
# # Use this cheatsheet as a quick reference guide as you work through the problems below.

# # Problem Set Version 1
# # Problem 1: Nested Constructors
# # Step 1: Copy the following code into Replit.

# # Step 2: Add a line of code (outside of the class) to create the linked list 4 -> 3 -> 2 
# # in a single assignment statement.

# # class Node:
# # 	def __init__(self, value, next=None):
# # 		self.value = value
# # 		self.next = next
# # ðŸ’¡ Hint: Nested Constructors

# # Problem 2: Find Frequency
# # Given the head of a linked list and a value val, return the frequency of val in the list. 
# # Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. 
# # Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your 
# # solution has the stated time and space complexity.

# notes:
# we are given head and val
# return the number of times val occurs in the list
# we can do this by traversing the linked list 
# starting with the head and ending at None
# we may also track the frequency of val by using a starting variable n and incrementing it by one and return the value it produce, hence n
# 1.start with the head
    # and n = 0
    #while head not none:
        # if val is_equal_to head.val:
            # increment n + 1
        # move to next node       


# # class Node:
# # 	def __init__(self, value, next=None):
# # 		self.value = value
# # 		self.next = next
# #     def count_element(head, val):
# #         n = 0
# #         while head:
# #             if head.val == val:
# #                 n+=1

# #             head= head.next
# #         return n
# #       	#start at the head
#     # traverse until we val == head.val:
#         # n+=1
# #   return n

# # Example Usage:

# # # Input List: 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1
# # # Input: head = 3, val = 1
# # Example Output:

# # # 2

# # Problem 3: Remove Tail
# # The following code attempts to remove the tail of a singly linked list. However, it has a bug!

# # Step 1: Copy this code into Replit.

# # Step 2: Create your own test cases to run the code against, and use print statements and the stack trace to
#  identify and fix the bug so that the function correctly removes the tail of the list.

# #     while current:
# #         print(current.value, end=" -> " if current.next else "")

# # Example Output:

# # # Expected Return Value: 1
# # # Expected Result List: 1 -> 2 -> 3

# # Problem 4: Find the Middle
# # A variation of the two-pointer technique introduced in Unit 4 is to have a slow and a fast pointer that increment at different rates. Given the head of a linked list, use the slow-fast pointer technique to find the middle node of a linked list. 
# If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

# # Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

# Problem 6: Merge Nodes Between Zeros in a Linked List
# Given the head of a linked list which contains a series of integers separated by 0s, merge the nodes lying between two zero nodes into a single node whose value is the sum of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any zeroes. The head and tail of the list will be nodes with value zero. Return the head of the merged list.

# Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.
