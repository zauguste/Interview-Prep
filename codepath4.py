# # Problem 2: Two-Pointer Reverse List
# # Write a function reverse_list() that takes in a list lst and returns elements of the list in reverse order.
# #  The list should be reversed in-place without using list slicing (e.g. lst[::-1]).

# # Instead, use the two-pointer approach, which is a common technique in which we 
# # initialize two variables (also called a pointer in this context) to track different indices or
# #  places in a list or string, then moves the pointers to point at new indices based on certain conditions.
# #  In the most common variation of the two-pointer approach, we initialize one variable to point at the 
# # beginning of a list and a second variable/pointer to point at the end of list. We then shift the
# #  pointers to move inwards through the list towards each other, until our problem is solved or the 
# # pointers reach the opposite ends of the list.
# # 
# # Check it!
# # we are given a list and we want reverse the list using the two pointer technique
# # does the data type in the array matter? No
# # are we ever given an empty array? Yes 
# # if given empty return 0

# #1 We should handle the first case 
# # if we are given an empty array:
#     #return 0
# #2 lets use the two pointer technique
# #1. initialize the left pointer at the beginning of the array
# #2. initialize the right pointer at the end of the array
# #3. whie l  < r swap
# #4. increment the left pointer incrment the left pointer
# #5. return the list 
# # so lets say we have our list [1,2,3,3,4,5]
# #                                   |
#         #                           |
